Questions -
DRC errors
  PO.S.4 (Space between poly = 0.1) Standard Cells = 0.11
  related to not having endcaps - minimum poly pitch - not using poly cut layer (PO Test1)
  PO.EX.2 (horizontal distance between PO and OD = 0.075) Standard Cells = 0.085

  Floating Gate
  Density (ODPO fill, don't use metal fill) will we meet metal density and dummy metal DRC if we don't use metal fill?
  Layers Required (will these go away after fill scripts)
  Diode
  Seal Ring
  PM layer necessary for DRC (PMET DRC errors) FBEOL option 1

Power Stripes & Clock (manual or automated)
- all by hand. Think about pad ring, cut cell etc.
- in innovus just auto generate pad ring. Bring into virtuoso for LVS and DRC. stream out netlist.
- can copy bond pad p-cell
- post_init.tcl, putting pad ontop of anything with PV
If clock tree is synthesized, NO.
What other routing can we automate? Only pad ring generation.
Look at IO app note: /afs/ece/class/ece725/tsmc28/pdk/TN28CLDR002_1_9/DRM/N28_IO_General_Application_Note.pdf
Pvdd needs three bond pads to same package pin.
Need to make bonding diagram reflect that.
Bond pad pitch rules - minimum is 70um
What post layout verification do we need (PVT corners, monte carlo, Periodic Steady State)

Notes from Apple & professors
Be wary of parasitic routing capitance
Minimize source drain diffusion
Source Drain Capacitance Estimation
Hold time
Clock tree buffers FO = 3
elmore time constant
elmore delay

min wire 
0.1 fF/um 
10 Ohm/um

make things as symmetric as possible
if asymmetric layout

if transient is really slow run use liberal
