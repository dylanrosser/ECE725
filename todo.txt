Questions -
DRC errors
  PO.S.4 (Space between poly = 1) Standard Cells = 0.11
  PO.EX.2 (horizontal distance between PO and OD = 0.075) Standard Cells = 0.085

  Floating Gate
  Density (ODPO fill, don't use metal fill) will we meet metal density and dummy metal DRC if we don't use metal fill?
  Layers Required (will these go away after fill scripts)
  Diode
  Seal Ring
  PM layer necessary for DRC (PMET DRC errors)

Power Stripes & Clock (manual or automated)
If clock tree is synthesized, do we still route clock in each custom logic cell
What other routing can we automate?
What post layout verification do we need (PVT corners, monte carlo, Periodic Steady State)

Notes from Apple & professors
Be wary of parasitic routing capitance
Minimize source drain diffusion
Source Drain Capacitance Estimation
Hold time
Clock tree buffers FO = 3
