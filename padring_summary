SUMMARY:
We will need to add a label for the POC cell (PVDD2POC) to pass LVS

ch 6:
filler: use wide first then small
if the empty space if longer then one digital cell they recommend using a dummy digital IO cell or core power cell
where dummy means not bonded
it is required to implement the bonded digital IO ground cell PVSS2DGZ or 3DGZ right next to each side of the corner cell for ESD consideration
only the VSS cus (global ESD bus) remain connected through the cut cell
PRCUT contains NWELL guard ring
for ESD and latch up it is required to implement the digital VSS (PVSS1 or 3 DGZ right next to the power cut cell

ch 7:
Simultaneous Switching and Ground Bounce
By referring to the DF table in the library databook, we can calculate the required number of bonded
I/O power/ground cell to avoid SSN in each digital domain, if there is any I/O cell used as the output
driver.
we might want someone to run through the calculation in section 7.3 to figure out the appropriate number of power/ground IO cells

ch 8:
section 8.5: 20pF minimum DECAP
The minimal capacitive load between the “AVDD” pin on the core side of (PVDD1ANA_V/H_G,
PVDD2ANA_V/H_G) and the “AVSS” pin on the core side of (PVSS1ANA_V/H_G,
PVSS2ANA_V/H_G) is 20pF.
If insufficient, it is required to insert the decoupling capacitor. Please refer to Figure 8.6 for
illustration.

section 8.6:
Required Per power domain:
(3) Bonded PVDD1GZ
(2) bonded PVDD2
(2) bonded PVDD2GZ
(1) PVDD2POC bonded or not
(1) PVSS1DGZ
if using PVDD1ANA you need at lease (3) and triple bond them
PVDD2ANA at least (2) needed for analog IO power
PVSS1 or 2ANA - (1) each is needed for analog core ground and IO ground
must use PCLAMP if using PVDD/PVSS1ANA (we're not I think)
there is a core clamp and an IO clamp labeled 1 and 2 respectively

If PDB3A/AC_V/H_G is connected to the internal gate, it is required to insert the
secondary ESD protection devices as illustrated in Figure 9.3 to ensure optimal ESD
protection.
5. If PDB3A/AC_V/H_G is connected to the internal drain, it is required to either insert the
secondary ESD protection devices as illustrated in Figure 9.5, or follow the ESD guideline
specified in TSMC Design Rule Manual. (These are analog signal pads for our track and hold)

it is required to implement the bonded PVSS2AC in the core voltage analog domain

the filler cell for the analog domain is PFILLERxA_G

it is required to implement analog power or ground PVDD3AC/PVSS3AC right next to the cut cell

minimum requirements for core voltage analog domain:
(3) PVDD3AC bonded
(3) PVDD1AC bonded to the same package pin
(1) PVSS3AC - might need/want more
PVSS2AC_V/H_G global ESD ground bus supply: this I/O is needed in case thethe VSS
bus resistance requirement cannot be fullfilled by the digital PVSS1DGZ_V/H_G. The
PVSS2AC_V/H_G / PVSS1DGZ_V/H_G must meet the VSS bus resistance requirement
PCLAMP_C should be used when using PVDD3AC/PVSS3AC
it is required to use at least 1 PCLAMPC macro along with the core voltage analog power-ground pair
refer to section 8.7 for the implementation of the Clamp. it is the same as for the ANA cells
It is required to implement the bonded ground cell (PVSS3A_V/H_G / PVSS3AC_V/H_G) right next
to each side of the PCORNERA_G corner cell for ESD robustness. Please refer to Section 0 for
details.

there is a checklist at the end of the file that can help us make sure we meet all the requirements
