Library: ece725_debug
virtuoso28p/simulation/debug_lowspeed:
50 sample clock periods worth of post-layout transient simulation at low speed
To be used to check relative prop. delay between DAC switches and comparators within core. (ignoring supply parasitics).

virtuoso28p/simulation/debug_sdr_highspeed
4 periods of transient only simulation at 50 MS/s fs, 1024 point
Use to check intrinsic SDR
Note: Pin locations have been changed in layout to better reflect points at which inputs are injected into core

ece725_debug/VREF_Parasitics:
Parasitic extract of VREF network
(Assume 4 pF per decap unit for pessimism).
